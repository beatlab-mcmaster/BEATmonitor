# Watch data files

By default, three folders are created in `src/dashboard/watchData`:

- `watchList`: This folder contains the list of all known watches. If you want to use a subset of watches, only include files for those watches in this directory.
- `transferredData`: This folder contains recorded data that have been transferred from watches to the host computer.
- `filesOnDevice`: This folder contains the names and sizes of files on each watch.
